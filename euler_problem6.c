// Problem 6
// The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
// 1*1 + 2*2...+10*10=385
// The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
// (1+2+...+10)^2=552=3025
// Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640.
// Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
